# Furniture detector

This project was created as a personal venture into deep neural networks. The code is not my own, I just selected which model I wanted to use. You can insert any image into this program and it will return the image, framing pieces of furniture with a bounding box, along with a label of the type of furniture it is.

## Detectron2

One of the libraries used is called Detectron2, a PyTorch-based modular object detection library created by a team at Facebook. More information can be found here : https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-detectron2-a-pytorch-based-modular-object-detection-library-/

Link to the team's github: https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2

Documentation: https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

## Requirements:

- Linux or macOS with Python ≥ 3.6

- PyTorch ≥ 1.6 and torchvision that matches the PyTorch installation. Install them together at pytorch.org to make sure of this

- OpenCV is optional but needed by demo and visualization

## Pytorch

Detectron2 uses pytorch, which is an open source machine learning framework:
